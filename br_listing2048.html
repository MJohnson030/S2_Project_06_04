    <h1>Listing 20481</h1>

    <p>Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly on a 6.8-acre
            high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature conservancy. The setting is
            exceptional, and the home is every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is 
            enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic flooring, custom 
            maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous windows, and incredible views.
            
            There is much more. The property includes a 40x54 storage building - perfect
            for a large boat and machinery. An exposed walkout on lower level leads down to
            a beautiful wooded area.
            
            An extra bathroom, bedroom, and family room can be added to the unfinished 
            basement for more living space.</p>
